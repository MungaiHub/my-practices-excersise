        <h1>About Monkey Bay</h1>
        <p>Welcome to <span class="highlight">Monkey Bay</span>, a social media platform designed to provide a fun and engaging experience for sharing videos. Our platform allows users to scroll through short video clips in a format similar to TikTok. The videos automatically play when snapped into view, thanks to the integration of JavaScript functionality, enhancing the user experience.</p>
        
        <p>While we focused on using HTML and CSS, we faced challenges such as working with an emerald green theme and including a JavaScript feature to make videos play only when visible. Through this project, we gained a deeper understanding of web technologies like CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, allowing us to create a more functional and visually appealing platform.</p>

        <p><span class="highlight">Team Achievements</span>: Our group learned the importance of collaboration and the balance between design and functionality. This project helped us develop a more intuitive user interface while also enhancing our coding skills.</p>
